# Instructions

Use phoenix commands if they are available for the task, such as `mix phx.gen`.
Code can be formatted with `mix format` or given more detailed lint messages with `mix credo`.
A custom mix command, `mix check`, will run `mix format && mix credo && mix compile` all together.
The app uses a dark mode with blue-ish hues, check core_components.ex, tailwind.config.js, and app.css for specifics.
Produce high-quality, well-structured, readable code with an appropriate ammount of useful comments.
